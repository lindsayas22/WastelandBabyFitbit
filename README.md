# WastelandBabyFitbit

A Fitbit clockface based on the musician Hozier's Wasteland, Baby! album cover.

Clock features:
* The album art background (painting by Raine Hozier-Byrne)  
* A top bar with current battery level, steps, and current heart rate  
* Time in the Hozier font  
* Date in Hozier's handwriting (designed by me using handwriting samples)  
* Made for a fitbit Versa, but is coded using percentages, so it might also work for an Ionic. Let me know if it doesn't!
